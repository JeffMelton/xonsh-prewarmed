## How it works

On first run of `xonsh-screen-prewarmed` script it creates additional reserved xonsh session in [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) manager in the background. On the next runs of the script it uses the reserved sessions and create new reserved sessions in the background. As result the speed of run the new interactive xonsh sessions is milliseconds.

## Installation

```xsh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anki-code/xonsh-prewarmed/main/xonsh-screen-prewarmed
chmod +x xonsh-screen-prewarmed
```

## Usage

```xsh
./xonsh-screen-prewarmed
```

## Add another session manager

Feel free to add another session manager (e.g. `tmux`, `zellij`) by creating `xonsh-<manager>-prewarmed`.

## Helpful GNU Screen cheatsheet

```xsh
screen -ls  # list of all screen sessions (the session id is the number before dot)
screen -r <sess_id>  # Jump to the `Detached` session by id
screen -rd <sess_id>  # Jump to the `Attached` session by id
# <Ctrl + a d>  # Detach current session (put it to the background)
```
