## How it works

On first run of `xonsh-screen-prewarmed` script it creates additional reserved xonsh session in [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) manager in the background. On the next runs of the script it uses the reserved sessions and create new reserved sessions in the background. As result the speed of run the new interactive xonsh sessions is milliseconds.

## Installation

```xsh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anki-code/xonsh-prewarmed/main/xonsh-screen-prewarmed
chmod +x xonsh-screen-prewarmed
```

## Usage

```xsh
./xonsh-screen-prewarmed
```

### GNU Screen cheatsheet

Basics:

* When you run `screen` the new session will be started and your current terminal will be attached to it.
* You can put the screen session to background by pressing `Ctrl + a` and then press `d`. After this your terminal will be detached from the session but the session will stay active in background.
* Run `screen -ls` to get list of all sessions. The `sess_id` is the number before dot.
* Run `screen -r <sess_id>` to attach `Detached` session to the current terminal.
* Run `screen -rd <sess_id>` to detach the `Attached` session and attach to the current terminal.
* Run `env | grep STY` to get current `sess_id`.

## Add another session manager

Feel free to add another session manager (e.g. `tmux`, `zellij`) by creating `xonsh-<manager>-prewarmed`.
